# SAT-Classification-Using-CNN
Classifying SAT-6 data using a CNN

Running instructions:

1. download SAT-6 data from here: http://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/deepsat/
2. Install Tensorflow (v 1.3) and tflearn.
3. Change paths to data in the jupyter notebooks.

Satellite imagery is important for many applications including disaster response, law enforcement, and environmental monitoring. These applications require the manual identification of objects and facilities in the imagery. Because the geographic expanses to be covered are great and the analysts available to conduct the searches are few, automation is required. Yet traditional object detection and classification algorithms are too inaccurate and unreliable to solve the problem. Deep learning is a family of machine learning algorithms that have shown promise for the automation of such tasks. It has achieved success in image understanding by means of convolutional neural networks.
